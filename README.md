# Computer Graphics Project 
# Flying Paper Plane Simulation

This project simulates a flying paper plane, birds, and clouds using Python and Matplotlib. The animation involves the transformation of the paper plane with scaling, rotation, shearing, and translation. It also features moving birds and clouds to create a dynamic scene in the sky.

## Features
- Animated flying paper plane with transformations (scaling, rotation, shearing, translation).
- Birds flying across the sky.
- Moving clouds that simulate a windy day.
- A sun in the background for a realistic setting.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
To run this project, make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
