# Computer Graphics Project 
Interactive 3D Cube with Transformations

This project is an interactive 3D cube visualizer built with Python, using Matplotlib and NumPy.
It allows users to apply real-time transformations to a 3D cube through an intuitive graphical interface.
Features

    🔵 Scaling: Resize the cube along the X, Y, and Z axes.

    🔴 Translation: Move the cube in 3D space.

    🟢 Reflection: Reflect the cube across different axes.

    🟠 Shearing: Apply shear transformations for slanting effects.

    🟣 Rotation: Rotate the cube around the Z-axis.

    🔁 Reset: Restore the cube to its original position and size.

Technologies Used

    Python 3.x

    Matplotlib

    NumPy

Installation

    Make sure you have Python installed.

    Install the required libraries:

pip install matplotlib numpy

Clone this repository and run the script:

    git clone https://github.com/yasmina/computer_graphics1.git
cd computer_graphics1
python interactive_cube.py


Usage

    Enter the desired values into the text fields next to each transformation.

    Click the corresponding button to apply the transformation.

    Click Reset to return the cube to its original state.

Purpose

This project is a simple demonstration of 3D transformations and matrix operations.
It can be used for educational purposes, helping students or beginners understand how scaling, translation, rotation, reflection, and shearing work in 3D space
